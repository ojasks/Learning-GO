is this language interpreted or compiled?
compiled -> code is converted to a .exe file and 
interpreted ---> code is run line by line like js

Golang is compiled
now what is the differemce between golang and other languages is that
--> it does meed any jvm(virtual machine)

Go tool can run file directly, without VM
executables are exported at compile time and different form os

What?
can be used from System Apps-Web apps = Cloud
already in production

* go mod init hello
go to main.go file

install vs code extensions
 
go is case sensitive

* go run main.go

* go help <command> helps u to know more about the command

so how is golang working fine without the semicolon even when the its the correct format of putting semicolon in the end 
why does golang remove the semicolon when a program is compiled

there are some places where u should'nt be putting semicolons so that lexer can come in and put it


-----> Types in golang



if u wont use fmt golang will automatically remove it and include it if u use it
in case of float 32 i get only 5 values after the decimal point

another thing about go 
is that it does;nt put any garbage valu

if u wont be declaring the carible type then the lexer comes in and says that i am gonna decide it for u
